# Example env file for local development and Vercel variables
# Copy this file to `.env.local` for local testing (DO NOT commit your real .env.local)

# EmailJS (Vite) - these are intentionally public/client-facing placeholders
VITE_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=service_xxxxxxx
VITE_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=template_xxxxxxx
VITE_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key_here
VITE_EMAILJS_OWNER_EMAIL=owner@example.com

# Notes:
# - Vite will expose variables that start with VITE_ into the client bundle.
#   Only use values here that are intended to be public (EmailJS public keys are designed for client use).
# - Do NOT put private secrets (API keys you want to keep private) with the VITE_ prefix.
#   Instead, store server-only secrets in Vercel env vars (no VITE_ prefix) and call them from a serverless function.

# Example server-only variables (if you implement server-side sending):
# SENDGRID_API_KEY=sk_live_xxx
# OWNER_EMAIL=owner@example.com
# FROM_EMAIL=you@your-domain.com
